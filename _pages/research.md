## Research Overview

My research lies at the intersection of **statistical machine learning, robust learning theory, and neural network modeling**, with the goal of developing **reliable, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware learning frameworks** for real-world data.  

I focus particularly on designing theoretically grounded machine learning methods that remain stable under **noise, outliers, class imbalance, and distributional shift**, and that provide trustworthy predictions in high-stakes domains such as biomedical and healthcare applications.
