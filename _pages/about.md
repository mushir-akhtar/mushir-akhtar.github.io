## Biography

Mushir Akhtar is a Ph.D. scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Indore, India, under the supervision of Prof. M. Tanveer and Dr. Mohd. Arshad. He received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mathematics from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, India, in 2018 and 2020, respectively, and was awarded the Gold Medal for securing the highest rank in M.Sc. Mathematics.

His research focuses on the development of robust, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware machine learning frameworks, with particular emphasis on support vector machines, randomized neural networks, probabilistic neural networks, and advanced loss-function design. His work further integrates statistical dependency modeling and copula theory to enhance the stability and generalization of learning systems, particularly for biomedical and healthcare applications.

He has authored several high-impact journal publications in venues such as *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, *IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems*, *Pattern Recognition*, *Neural Networks*, and *Applied Soft Computing*. He is the recipient of the Institute Best Research Paper Award (IIT Indore, 2025) and has multiple papers accepted at leading international conferences, including AISTATS, IJCNN, ICONIP, and ICPR.

Beyond research, he actively contributes to the academic community through reviewing for leading journals and conferences. He currently serves as Vice-Chair of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Student Branch Chapter and Treasurer of the IEEE Student Branch Chapter at IIT Indore.
