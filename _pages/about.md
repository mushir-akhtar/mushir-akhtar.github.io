## Biography

Mushir Akhtar is a Ph.D. scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Indore, India, under the supervision of [Prof. M. Tanveer](https://mtanveer.profiles.iiti.ac.in/) and [Dr. Mohd. Arshad](https://people.iiti.ac.in/~arshad/index.html). He received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mathematics from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, India, in 2018 and 2020, respectively, and was awarded the Gold Medal for securing the highest rank in M.Sc. Mathematics.

His research lies at the intersection of robust machine learning, uncertainty-aware modeling, and interpretable and trusthworthy AI. His early work focused on designing theoretically grounded loss functions to address noise, outliers, and class imbalance, leading to robust learning frameworks for support vector machines, randomized neural networks, and restricted kernel machines applied to clinical prediction tasks. Through this work, he identified a fundamental limitation of conventional models: their reliance on point-estimate predictions with limited uncertainty characterization and weak density-level interpretability, which can hinder trust in high-stakes biomedical settings. Motivated by these challenges, his recent research has shifted toward probabilistic and density-aware neural learning frameworks that provide uncertainty quantification and clinically meaningful interpretability. In parallel, he investigates statistical modeling of feature dependencies using copula theory to capture structured relationships in biomedical variables and to strengthen probabilistic inference in machine learning systems.

He has authored several high-impact journal publications in venues such as IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (Impact Factor: 18.6), IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems (Impact Factor: 11.9), Pattern Recognition (Impact Factor: 7.6), Neural Networks (Impact Factor: 6.3), and Applied Soft Computing (Impact Factor: 6.6). He is the recipient of the Institute Best Research Paper Award (IIT Indore, 2025) and has multiple first author papers accepted at leading international conferences, including AISTATS (CORE Rank A), IJCNN, ICONIP, and ICPR.

Beyond research, he actively contributes to the academic community through reviewing for leading journals and conferences. He currently serves as Vice-Chair of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Student Branch Chapter and Treasurer of the IEEE Student Branch Chapter at IIT Indore.
